Simple game, canâ€™t figure out this probability.

Coin toss: Heads = +1, Tails =-1. 3rd consecutive head onwards is worth +2. Consecutive tails is always -1.

E.g. H,H,H,H,T,T,T,T,T,H,H,T,H

is worth: +1,+1,+2,+2,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,+1,+1,-1,+1
with an overall score of +3.

For what p(heads) is the long term expected value 0?
